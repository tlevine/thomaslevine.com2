Prevalence of Middle Names

Draft

I was wondering what proportion of people have middle names, so I asked the Census.

Since they didn't know, I looked at students at a university. Cornell University
email addresses can contain two or three letters, depending on whether the Cornellian
has a middle name. I [retrieved](https://gitorious.org/tlevine/toilet_survey/blobs/master/sample/ced.sh)
all of the email addresses of then-current Cornell University students from the
[Cornell Electronic Directory](http://www.it.cornell.edu/services/thunderbird/howto/troubleshooting_detail.cfm?id=143944)
and came up with this plot.

![A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University shows
that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the proportion varies
substantially by school, the graduate school having a particularly low
rate of middle names and the agriculture school having a particularly high rate.

Based on discussions with some of the students in that census,
I suspected that students underreport rather than
[overreport](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJgaaAfhR5I&t=7m51s)
middle names and that the under-reporting is generally an accident.

A year later, I finally got around to testing that.
I [looked at](https://github.com/tlevine/united-states-middlenames)
the names of [85,822,194 dead Americans](http://ssdmf.info)
and came up with some more plots.

[![Plot of middle name prevalence as a function of time by state, showing
a relatively sharp increase from 10% to 80% between 1880 and 1930, followed
by a plateau until 1960, followed by a smaller jump to 95% by 1975

The rate of middle names these days is about 90%, which is a lot more
than the Cornell University student figures; this supports my suspicion
that people under-report rather than over-report.

I was somewhat surprised that reported middle name prevalance varied so much
over time but so relatively little by state. I suspect that most of the
increase over time is explained by improved of office procedures, but I
wonder what explains derivative valleys around 1955 and 1990.
But the death file provides a lot more data than I've shown you here, so
check with me in a few weeks to see what I come up with.
