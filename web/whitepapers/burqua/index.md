Burqua

I wear a burqua to drag parties.

<!-- Insert image here. -->

This is hilarious for a few relatively superficial reasons.

* Nobody else does it.
* It's a lot more convincing than other drag.
* Even though it conceals me, it is totally obvious that I'm under it as nobody else would ever do it.

But its real hilarity comes from a deeper troll.

The garment offends the hippie liberal Americans who say that it is a symbol of repression
of women by extreme forms of Islam and that it is not funny. This stereotypical American
doesn't realize how awesome burquas are, portrays extreme Muslims as immoral pigs, and overestimates
how many Muslims of this sort exist.

Conversely, the garment surely offends those extreme Muslims that those hippie liberal Americans
oppose. I, a male, am wearing a burqua to an indecent American \emph{drag party}.

It's funny enough that I'd manage to offend these two opposing groups. The hilarity is
even further increased by the notion that I am the most modestly dressed of any of the
partiers; with everyone else dressed as stereotypical sluts or pimps, if at all, I'm
the last partier who should offend you.
