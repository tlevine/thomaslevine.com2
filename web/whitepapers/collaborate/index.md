Frivolity
============
Draft

I seek opportunities to help people work less and think more.
Here are a few ways that I tend to do that.

## Automation of manual processes
I replace menial human work with computers.
This is currently my [full-time gig](https://scraperwiki.com).

## Ergonomics
When computers can't do something, I make it easier for people to do them.
I am especially interested in the causes and effects of computer use
and in people's manner of toilet use, but I am interested in most
evdeavours to figure out how people think and behave.

## Quantitative analytics
When you are pondering big questions, numbers can help.

## Contact
Get in touch if you think I can help with an endeavour
to reduce work and increase thought.

For projects related to toilets specifically, please
contact the [Whitby Group](http://whitbygroup.com),
where I am currently a partner.
