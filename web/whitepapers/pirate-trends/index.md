Pirate Trends
======
Draft

<!-- With the digitization of content, the cost of its distribution... -->

I would like to help content creators thrive in a world
where media piracy is the norm. As a sample of what I can do,
I've created PirateTrends.

PirateTrends helps musicians and filmmakers find their fans
geographically in order to help them plan concerts and screenings.
