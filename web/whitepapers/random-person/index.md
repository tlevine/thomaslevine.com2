Random Person of the Week
========
April 1, 2008

My friend Greg Zecchini ran for school president our junior year with the platform of bringing more awesome to the school. Among his proposals was instituting a Random Person of the Week to be chosen at random each week and announced over the public announcement system in homeroom.

He didn't win, so I started it. I selected random persons from the student telephone directory and posted posters announcing the persons. I was able to post the posters under the auspices of the philosophy club, of which I was a president, I think.

## Postering hack
Clubs were allowed to post 25 posters per event around the school,
so I just put in a note about philosophy club meeting times at the bottom of the poster.
I don't think anybody ever came as a result of these posters.

One week, I had three different clubs get the posters approved;
I was thus able to post 75 of the posters!

## First random person
Initially, I called people beforehand to make sure they wouldn't totally freak out by being named Random Person of the Week. The first time, two people declined to be the Random Person of the Week. I knew the first Random Person of the Week, Melissa Perry, so she accepted and also said I could use her picture in the poster. Acquiring pictures wound up to be more work than I felt like putting into this, so that was the only one to ever have a picture of the person.

## Concern over selection bias
Initially, the Random Person of the Week was selected from students. I soon acquired a list of faculty and added them to the pool. At some point, some people started questioning the randomness because it seemed that disproportionately many faculty were being selected, so I analyzed this statistically. I found more faculty were indeed being selected than one would expect on average but that such variability was not significant enough to suggest bias in the selection process. I wrote this up and posted it around school.

## Extensions
I eventually had Random Person of the Week announcements run in the daily paper bulletin sent to homerooms and in the announcements "board" in the high school commons.
  (It was really a television screen hooked up to a desktop computer.
   My guess as to why it was called a "board" is that it may have been
   some sort of true board decades ago; the name probably stuck when
   the new technology came around.)
I also started the "Poke the Random Person of the Week" Facebook group
and developed automated systems for selecting random persons weekly and
creating posters.

## University
I tried starting it up at university, but it didn't catch on. I think part of the issue was that the university was too large.
