Christmas Gifts
======
January 5, 2011

How many gifts did my true love give to me on all twelve nights of Christmas?

After seeing Information is Beautiful's recent information animation,
I decided that I'd make [my own](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLZDvXPIDa0).

I used R to [generate a PDF](http://gitorious.org/tlevine/12daysplot/blobs/master/12daysslideshow.R)
and then did a screencast of the PDF with ffmpeg to make a video with the appropriate timings.
