Selling my Lenovo Y560 Laptop
=========
Draft

I am selling my Lenovo IdeaPad Y560 15.6” laptop. Here is a picture of it on my head.

I purchased it two years ago from Newegg.

I’m selling it because I haven’t been using it very much now that I have a Linode.

I’ve wiped the hard drive and can install Windows 7 Home (It came with the computer.) or any reasonable GNU/Linux distribution on it.

Aside one significant cosmetic problem, it works quite fine. That one cosmetic problem is a line of dead pixels down the center of the screen. (It's pretty exactly in the center--maybe two millimeters off.) They died about a year ago. They haven't been a problem for me because I normally have two windows open, one on each side of the screen, but they might be a problem for you.

Now some more pictures!

Here it is on my desk.

There a scratch on the down-arrow key.

Newegg has a nice diagram of the size.

It comes with the power adapter and cord, and, of course, the battery.

For comparison, here’s what it costs on eBay.

I would like $420 for it.
